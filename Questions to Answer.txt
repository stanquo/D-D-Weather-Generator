What pieces of information are being entered by the operator? (With example input)

Dropdown menus are the ideal way of inputting information, with only 2 dropdown menus being needed: Country and Season
It would be ideal if choosing the country would filter out unusable seasons.
Athena has no desire to type anything in using the keyboard.

i.e. Country: Danechka  Season: Spring
i.e. Country: Iacopo  Season: Dry


How should the output be formatted? (With example optimal output)

Text output only
Nothing needs to be saved
Use the format of the examples below

i.e.	Sunny
	Partly Cloudy
	Incredibly Windy
	30 - 40 degrees

# degrees can either be typed out or use the degree symbol
# input for this would've been: Country: Danechka, Season: Spring

i.e.	Heavy Snow
	Moderate Fog
	-5 - 5 degrees

# input for this would've been: Country: Danechka, Season: Winter
# it is not necessary to display any output for any weather add-on that is not used; in the above example, no wind was rolled randomly, so it was omitted from the output
